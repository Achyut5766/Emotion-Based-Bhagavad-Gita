# Emotion-Based-Bhagavad-Gita

The application begins by asking the user how they feel. Once an emotion is selected, the system responds by displaying a verse that speaks to that emotion. Along with the chapter number and verse number, the verse is presented in three different languages — Hindi, English, and Kannada — to ensure accessibility for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds. To help the user understand the deeper meaning, the verse’s explanation in English is also displayed in a clear, simplified manner.
But the system doesn’t stop at just the verse — it goes a step further by showing a short moral story related to the selected emotion. This story helps the user relate the verse to real-life situations and better understand how their current emotion might affect their thoughts and actions. It creates a moment of self-reflection, guiding the user gently toward inner peace and wisdom — just as the Gita itself intended.
From a technical perspective, the project is built using a Java-based backend with Java Swings used for creating the graphical user interface. This allows the application to run smoothly on desktops and laptops, providing a familiar and responsive experience. The data — including verses, stories, and emotion mappings — is securely stored and managed using SQL Server, ensuring that all content is organized, easy to access, and safe.
